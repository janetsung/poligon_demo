May plans for second Brexit vote if Labour talks fail	British Prime Minister Theresa May has carried out "scenario planning" for a second Brexit referendum in case she is forced by parliament to hold one, according to UK media reports.<br><br>Mrs May is hoping to find a way to get parliament to approve a Brexit plan without another public vote, but talks with the opposition Labour Party on a compromise exit strategy have yet to reach an agreement.<br><br>The 'Daily Telegraph' reported Mrs May had discussions with officials and ministers about holding a referendum that would give voters the choice between leaving the European Union with a deal, leaving without a deal, or not leaving at all.<br><br>The report cited unnamed government sources, who said the referendum plan would only become relevant if talks with Labour failed and a majority in parliament supported holding another public vote.<br><br>The newspaper said a source in Mrs May's office denied there had been a meeting to discuss a second EU referendum.<br><br>Britain's 2016 vote to leave the EU, which was split 52pc for Brexit and 48pc against, has continued to divide the country and paralyse the political system.<br><br>Mrs May's minority government missed a March 29 exit date and there is huge uncertainty over how, when, and even if Britain will leave.<br><br>She has publicly opposed holding a second referendum and has said if talks with Labour fail, parliament will be asked to vote on a series of options on how to break the impasse. However, those options have not yet been decided.<br><br>Talks with Labour, which has pledged conditional support for a second referendum, are due to resume today and ministers have spent recent days talking up the prospect of a swift deal.<br><br>However, leaked details on a possible compromise have angered Labour's negotiators, and politicians from both sides have expressed their opposition to a cross-party deal.<br><br>Ministers have urged Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn to do a deal with the Conservative government to break the deadlock.<br><br>Reports over the weekend suggested Mrs May was poised to propose a temporary customs arrangement with the European Union.<br><br>But shadow chancellor John McDonnell accused the prime minister of jeopardising the talks, claiming she had "blown the confidentiality" of the discussions.<br><br>He said he no longer trusts Mrs May, following reports in the 'Sunday Times' she was prepared to give ground in three areas: customs, goods alignment and workers' rights.<br><br>Meanwhile, Rory Stewart, the newly appointed international development secretary, warned the Tories could lose four million voters if the party takes a harder line on Brexit and tries to "outdo" Nigel Farage.<br><br>He said Labour and the Conservatives' positions were a "quarter of an inch apart", telling Sky News' 'Sophy Ridge of Sunday': "I think a deal can be done, a lot of this rests on whether Jeremy Corbyn really wants to deliver a Brexit deal. But I think if he wants to do it, it will be actually surprisingly easy to do because our positions are very, very close."<br><br>And Mrs May wrote in the 'Mail on Sunday': "To the leader of the opposition, I say this: let's listen to what the voters said in the elections and put our differences aside for a moment. Let's do a deal."<br><br>Elsewhere, a poll by political blog Conservative Home found 82pc of respondents want Mrs May to stand down as party leader and to call a leadership election.<br><br>Mr Stewart, who also confirmed he would be a candidate to be the next prime minister when Mrs May stands down, said: "Most Brexit voters voted for the Conservative Party but four million Remain voters voted for the Conservative Party. If the Conservative Party were to make the mistake of trying to outdo Nigel Farage, which I'm sure we won't but it is something that a few of my colleagues are talking about, then we would lose those four million voters."
Labour MPs say they won't back a Brexit deal without a people’s vote	Jeremy Corbyn will not be able to get enough of his MPs to back a Brexit deal without the promise of a second referendum, even if Theresa May makes a big offer on a customs union and workers’ rights this week, senior Labour figures believe.<br><br>Senior party sources said they believe two-thirds of Labour MPs, including several shadow cabinet ministers and many more frontbenchers, would refuse to back a deal without a people’s vote attached.<br><br>Theresa May is preparing to make new proposals of a temporary customs union until the next election, matching EU employment rights in the future and alignment of single market regulations on goods.<br><br>The prime minister wrote an article in the Mail on Sunday urging Labour to “put our differences aside for a moment” to do a deal when negotiators meet on Tuesday, while Corbyn said after the local election results that voters wanted MPs to “get a deal done” on Brexit.<br><br>John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, had said on Friday that the election results meant voters were saying “sort it” on Brexit but he sounded a more cautious note about the prospect of a deal on Sunday, telling the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show that he had no trust in May and accusing her of negotiating in “bad faith”.<br><br>He said any customs union would need to be permanent and warned No 10 that “to get any deal over the line you’ve got to recognise there will be a large number of MPs in parliament who actually do support a public vote”.<br><br>Labour is incensed that details of May’s intended offer were leaked to Sunday newspapers when they had kept their side of a bargain to keep the talks confidential. Asked whether he trusted the prime minister over the talks, McDonnell said: “No, sorry, not after this weekend when she’s blown the confidentiality I had and I actually think she’s jeopardised the negotiations for her own personal protection.”<br><br>McDonnell also raised the issue of May’s weak position as leader and the threat of hard Brexiters vying to take over from her, likening the cross-party talks to “trying to enter a contract with a company going into administration and the people who are going to take over are not willing to fulfil that contract”.<br><br>The shadow chancellor made clear that Labour would need changes to the withdrawal agreement and political declaration negotiated with the EU to make sure future Tory leaders could not tear up the agreement after Brexit.<br><br>More than 100 opposition MPs, including 66 from Labour, said at the weekend they would not tolerate a “Westminster stitch-up” on a Brexit deal without a second referendum.<br><br>But a number of MPs close to the People’s Vote campaign believe there are actually more like 150 to 180 Labour MPs out of 229 who will refuse to back a deal struck with May unless there is a confirmatory vote.<br><br>One shadow cabinet minister said: “Jeremy cannot be sure he has the numbers – even if he whipped it – so he cannot do a deal without a confirmatory vote.”<br><br>Several MPs talked of more colleagues quitting the party, frontbench walkouts and a “catastrophic split” if the leadership were to pursue a policy of a deal without another referendum.<br><br>May is opposed to offering a second referendum but parliament could decide to back one if the talks collapse and the government proceeds with a plan for binding votes on what MPs would prefer as an outcome. In that scenario, there could be a binary referendum on May’s Brexit deal or some kind of three-way poll on Brexit with the options of a deal, no deal or remaining in the EU.<br><br>Although striking any deal with May would be controversial within Labour, some within the party, such as party chair Ian Lavery and MPs Lucy Powell and Stephen Kinnock, have been arguing that the referendum result needs to be respected. There is also an argument being made that it could be the best way of drawing a line under Brexit and moving on to talk about other pressing national issues such as schools and hospitals.<br><br>Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, is sticking to his promise to keep the negotiations confidential but a number of MPs said they had been reassured personally that he would not sign up to any deal without a public vote.<br><br>Even some of those who had been considering backing any cross-party deal were spooked by May’s Mail on Sunday article that tries to sell a temporary customs union until 2022 on the grounds that whoever wins a general election can set the future direction. They fear this could amount to signing up to a “blind Brexit” in which hard Brexiter successors to May such as Boris Johnson and Dominic Raab could set the terms of the future relationship.<br><br>Tom Watson, the party’s deputy leader who has been pushing for an unequivocal second referendum policy, told the BBC Radio 5 Live’s Pienaar’s Politics that “the Labour party membership and vast numbers of my colleagues in parliament don’t want us to just sign off on a Tory Brexit”. He said a deal would only be done if Starmer, who backs a second referendum, approved it.<br><br>Meanwhile, May is facing the prospect of a Tory revolt and losing votes for her deal if she makes any promise of a permanent customs union, with at least 100 of her MPs unwilling to vote for such a compromise.<br><br>Two senior Conservatives, Ruth Davidson, the Scottish Tory leader, and Rory Stewart, the international development secretary, both offered a view that the major parties needed to find a compromise. Stewart even suggested a split in the Tory party could be a price worth paying to get a Brexit deal done, telling Pienaar’s Politics: “Yes, there will be short-term pain.”<br><br>He also urged the prime minister to find a binding solution on a customs union with Labour, claiming: “We need investors to feel this will be there for 30 years not just for four years and a cross-party deal is a way to do with.”<br><br>However, the idea of a binding customs union incensed Conservative Brexiters, who are ramping up their efforts to oust May in the wake of the dire local election results for the party.<br><br>Sir Graham Brady, the chair of the 1922 Committee of backbenchers, warned May in the Telegraph that she must not cave on the issue of the customs union.<br><br>“The temptation for the government now to do whatever is necessary to secure some kind of Brexit agreement is obvious but it must be resisted,” he said.<br><br>“To reach an agreement with Labour that locked the United Kingdom into the customs union might pull in enough Labour votes to allow an agreement to limp over the line but the price could be a catastrophic split in the Conservative party and at a time when the opposition is led by dangerous extremists, the consequences for our country would be unthinkable.”<br><br>Brady is expected to lead a delegation of the 1922 to see May on Tuesday asking her to set out a timetable for her departure or face serious attempts to remove her.
Jeremy Corbyn: Second referendum could heal the UK	Speaking in Kent, Corbyn said a confirmatory vote on any deal agreed with Brussels could help bring the Brexit process to a “conclusion”.<br><br>Labour’s official party policy is to push for a referendum if it cannot take over Brexit negotiations by winning a general election.<br><br>Yet when the party began talking to the government in April in a bid to find a way through the deadlock, a spokesperson insisted a second referendum would be to stop a “damaging Tory Brexit” - not to give the green-light to any deal struck between the two frontbenches.<br><br>At the launch of Labour’s European Parliament election campaign, Corbyn appeared to adopt a softer approach, saying: “The view we put forward, the party conference put this forward, the national executive agreed this, [was] that we should include the option of having a ballot on a public vote on the outcome of the talks and negotiations on what we’re putting forward. I would want that to be seen as a healing process, and bringing this whole process to a conclusion.<br><br>“Nothing is easy in this. But our essential message has to be to bring people together and that’s the basis on which we’ve approached both what we’ve done in parliament and in the negotiations itself.”<br><br>Corbyn had earlier seemed to pay down the possibility of another public vote, saying: "Over 17 million people voted to leave the European Union. As democratic socialists, we cannot ignore that.<br><br>"We voted to trigger Article 50 in 2017 and promised to respect the referendum in our general election manifesto and again at our party conference last year."<br><br>Labour’s Brexit policy is to enter into a customs union with the EU, but also seek to retain influence over trade policy.<br><br>Staying in the customs union alone would not guarantee frictionless trade with the EU, as checks would still need to be carried out to ensure goods adhered to Single Market rules.<br><br>An analysis by the the National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR) claimed the UK would be three per cent poorer over the next ten years under Labour’s plans compared to staying in the EU.<br><br>NIESR economist Garry Young said: “Leaving the EU for a customs union will make it more costly for the UK to trade with a large market on our doorstep, particularly in services which make up 80 percent of our economy.”<br><br>The European Parliament elections are set to take place on May 23, and Nigel Farage’s Brexit Party are currently predicted to emerge victorious.
